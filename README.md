🦅 Sky Guardian AI

AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (Local ML Edition)
Built with discipline, purpose, and a vision for world-class engineering.

░░ About Sky Guardian AI — And Why I Built It

Hi, I’m Jobanjit Singh — a Cloud, Network, DevOps, and Security Engineer who believes modern infrastructure should be intelligent, self-aware, and predictive.

After years of handling outages, debugging logs, fixing broken configs, and managing distributed systems, I realized something important:

There must be a smarter way to understand and protect systems.

Sky Guardian AI is my personal attempt to build that smarter way —
a platform that thinks like an engineer, analyzes like an AI, and protects like a guardian.

This project represents my engineering identity and my long-term mission to contribute to advanced AI-powered infrastructure engineering in the United States.

░░ What Sky Guardian AI Does

Sky Guardian AI is a fully offline, local-ML-powered intelligence platform that:

Analyzes logs through pattern detection

Detects anomalies using ML models

Groups similar issues using embeddings

Highlights high-risk events and unusual behavior

Scans cloud-style configs for misconfigurations

Suggests intelligent recommendations

Generates clean incident summaries

All without any APIs.
No keys.
No cost.
Pure engineering + local AI.

░░ Why This Project Matters to Me

This project is deeply personal.

It reflects my passion for Cloud, DevOps, Networking, Security, and AI — and the type of intelligent automation I want to build professionally in the US tech industry.

It's not just code.
It's a statement of discipline, ambition, and engineering vision.

Sky Guardian AI is the perfect intersection of:

Cloud + Networking

Security + DevOps

AI + Automation

Real-world problem solving

This is the engineering path I want to pursue for the next decade.
