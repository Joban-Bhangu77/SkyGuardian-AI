🦅 Sky Guardian AI

AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (Local ML Edition)
Created with purpose, discipline and a vision for world-class engineering.

░░ About Sky Guardian AI — And Why I Built It

Hi, I’m Jobanjit Singh — a Cloud, Network, DevOps & Security Engineer who believes infrastructure should be intelligent, predictive and self-healing.

After years of resolving outages, debugging production issues, and protecting cloud networks, one thing became clear:

There must be a smarter and more automated way to understand systems.

Sky Guardian AI is my attempt to build that intelligent guardian —
a local-AI platform that analyzes logs, detects anomalies, evaluates cloud risks, and recommends fixes without relying on paid APIs.

This project is not just technical — it’s personal, tied to my long-term vision to grow into a world-class engineer and build a future in the United States.

░░ What Sky Guardian AI Does

Sky Guardian AI is a fully offline AI/ML powered platform that:

Understands and analyzes logs

Detects abnormal activity

Clusters similar errors using embeddings

Highlights anomalies using ML

Scans cloud-style configurations

Identifies security gaps

Suggests intelligent remediation steps

Generates human-readable incident summaries

All using local machine learning models, making it secure, lightweight and production-friendly.

░░ Why This Project Matters to Me

Because this is the exact kind of engineering I want to build in the US —
secure, automated, intelligent systems that solve problems before humans notice them.

Sky Guardian AI represents:

my discipline

my learning journey

my AI foundations

my cloud + networking expertise

and my long-term commitment to innovation

This project is both technical work and personal evolution.
