🦅 Sky Guardian AI

AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (Local ML Edition)
Built with intention, discipline, and a vision for world-class engineering.

About Sky Guardian AI — And Why I Built It

Hi, I’m Jobanjit Singh — a Cloud, Network, DevOps & Security Engineer who believes modern infrastructure should be smart, self-aware, and automated.

After years of responding to outages, analyzing logs, handling cloud/network incidents, and managing distributed systems, I realized something important:

There needs to be a more intelligent, AI-assisted way to understand and protect systems.

Sky Guardian AI is that attempt.
A fully local AI platform that analyzes logs, detects anomalies, evaluates cloud risks, and suggests fixes — with no API keys, no cost, and full control.

It reflects my personal journey and my long-term mission to build advanced infrastructure tools in the United States.

What Sky Guardian AI Does

Sky Guardian AI is a local-machine-learning–driven platform that:

Analyzes logs

Detects anomalies using ML

Groups similar issues with embeddings

Highlights unusual behavior

Scans cloud-style configurations

Identifies security gaps

Suggests intelligent remediation

Generates incident summaries

All offline.
All local.
All engineered with precision.

Why This Project Matters

This isn’t just a project.
It’s a statement of my engineering philosophy — building systems that are:

intelligent

automated

reliable

secure

and future-ready

This project combines my skills in:

Cloud Engineering

Networking

Security

DevOps/SRE

Python

Machine Learning

And represents the kind of engineering I want to contribute to in the US tech industry.
