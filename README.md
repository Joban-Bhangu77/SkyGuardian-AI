# 🦅 Sky Guardian AI
### ⚡ AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (100% Local ML)
**Created by Jobanjit Singh | Cloud ☁️ | DevOps 🚀 | Network 🌐 | Security 🔐 | AI 🤖**

---

# ⭐ Overview
Sky Guardian AI is a **local machine-learning intelligence platform** that analyzes logs, detects anomalies, scans cloud-style configurations, and generates smart insights — all **fully offline**, using **local ML models only** (no API keys, no billing).

This project reflects my real-world engineering experience and my mission to build intelligent automation systems that combine **Cloud, Networking, DevOps, Security, and AI**.

---

# 🎯 Purpose
Modern infrastructure generates massive noise:
- Logs 📄  
- Alerts 🚨  
- Security risks 🔐  
- Misconfigurations ⚠️  
- Unknown failures ❓  

**Sky Guardian AI** is designed to act as a **guardian**:  
A smart system that thinks like an engineer and analyzes like an AI.

# 🔥 Why I Built This
During my engineering journey across Cloud, Networking, and Security, I faced:
- Unexplained outages  
- Chaotic logs  
- Slow root-cause investigations  
- Security blind spots  
- Cloud configuration mistakes  

I wanted a system that:
- Understands patterns  
- Detects issues early  
- Supports engineers  
- Predicts failures  
- Enhances decision-making  

Sky Guardian AI is that system.  
A reflection of my engineering mindset and my long-term dream to innovate within US tech environments.
