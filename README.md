🦅 Sky Guardian AI
⚡ AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform

by Jobanjit Singh — Cloud ☁️ | DevOps 🚀 | Network 🌐 | Security 🔐 | AI 🤖

⭐ Overview

Sky Guardian AI is a 100% local machine-learning intelligence platform designed to analyze logs, detect anomalies, scan cloud-style configurations, and generate automated insights — all without using any APIs.

This project reflects my engineering journey and ambition to build intelligent automation systems that bring together Cloud, Networking, Security, DevOps, and AI.

🎯 Purpose

Modern systems create massive noise:
logs, alerts, anomalies, and configuration risks.

Sky Guardian AI acts as your AI Guardian, helping engineers understand issues faster, detect abnormal behavior early, and simplify infrastructure debugging.

🔥 Why I Built This

After years working in Cloud, Networking, Security, and DevOps, I realized:

Outages are often predictable

Logs hide patterns humans miss

Cloud configs break silently

Security issues slip under the radar

AI can help us work smarter

This project is also a part of my goal to build high-quality engineering systems and grow my career in the United States.
