🦅 Sky Guardian AI
⚡ AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (100% Local ML)

Created by Jobanjit Singh | Cloud ☁️ | DevOps 🚀 | Network 🌐 | Security 🔐 | AI 🤖

⭐ 1. About This Project

Sky Guardian AI is a smart, AI-assisted, local-machine-learning platform that analyzes logs, detects anomalies, highlights risks, and provides intelligent insights for cloud and network environments.

This project represents my real-world engineering experience and my mission to build intelligent automation systems that support Cloud, DevOps, Networking, Security, and AI workflows.

It reflects my long-term commitment to world-class engineering and my ambition to innovate in the United States tech industry.

🔥 2. Why I Built Sky Guardian AI

As an engineer, I’ve faced:

🚨 Outages nobody could explain

📊 Huge log dumps with no clarity

🔥 Broken cloud configs

🔍 Hidden security gaps

🕒 Long troubleshooting sessions

I always believed there should be a smarter, AI-powered guardian for systems —
one that detects problems before engineers even notice.

Sky Guardian AI is that guardian.
Fully offline. Fully intelligent. Fully engineered with purpose.
