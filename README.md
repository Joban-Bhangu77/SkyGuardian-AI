🦅 Sky Guardian AI
AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform (Built With Passion & Purpose)

Created by Jobanjit Singh – Cloud | DevOps | Network | Security Engineer on a mission to build world-class systems and a world-class life.

🤍 About Sky Guardian AI — And Why I Built It

Hi, I’m Jobanjit Singh, an engineer who has spent years working across Cloud, Network Security, Infrastructure, DevOps, and Automation.

Like most engineers, I’ve lived through real production problems:

Logs exploding at 3 AM

Outages nobody could explain

Servers misbehaving

Cloud configs going wrong

Security gaps hiding in plain sight

Systems breaking without warning

I always believed there should be a smarter, AI-powered way to understand infrastructure.

Sky Guardian AI is my personal attempt to build that system —
a tool that thinks like an engineer, analyzes like AI, and protects like a guardian.

This is more than a project.
It’s the beginning of the kind of engineering I want to bring to the United States:
intelligent, automated, safe, scalable infrastructure powered by AI.

🌩️ What Sky Guardian AI Actually Does

Sky Guardian AI is a local-machine-learning–powered platform that:

Reads & understands logs

Detects unusual patterns

Clusters similar issues using AI

Highlights anomalies

Scans cloud-style configurations

Identifies misconfigurations

Recommends fixes

Generates incident summaries

All offline.
No API keys.
No paid models.
Just pure engineering and local Machine Learning.

🧠 Why AI? Why This Project?

Because the future of Cloud, DevOps, Networking, and Security is:

AI-assisted

Self-healing

Predictive instead of reactive

Automated rather than manual

I want to build systems that solve problems before they hit engineers.
This is the engineering mindset I want to carry into the US workforce —
and Sky Guardian AI is a reflection of that commitment.

🌍 My Mission Behind This Project

I am building Sky Guardian AI as part of my long-term vision:

to master advanced Cloud + AI engineering

to showcase real-world system design

to build intelligent automation tools

to push myself technically every day

and ultimately,
to move to the United States and contribute at the highest level of engineering.

This project is not just code —
It is proof of discipline, vision, and the hunger to grow into a world-class engineer.

🧩 Conclusion

Sky Guardian AI is a reflection of:

my engineering journey,

my curiosity for solving real problems,

my passion for automation,

my commitment to AI,

and my dream to build a future in the United States.

Every line of code I write here represents the values I want to bring to my next role:
clarity, precision, intelligence, automation, and reliability.

This project will continue evolving —
just like me.
