🚀 Sky Guardian AI

AI-Powered Cloud, Network & Security Analysis Platform
by Jobanjit Singh – Cloud | DevOps | Network | Security | AI

🧊 Overview
Sky Guardian AI is a local-machine-learning platform designed to analyze logs,
detect anomalies, assess cloud-style configurations, and generate intelligent insights.
It is engineered to run 100% offline using local ML models.

🎯 Purpose of This Project
To build an intelligent guardian that understands infrastructure,
detects risks before outages occur, assists engineers with AI-powered insights,
and showcases real-world engineering depth across Cloud, DevOps, Networking, Security, and AI.

🧠 Why I Built It
After years of handling production issues, analyzing logs, and securing networks,
I realized modern systems need AI-assisted intelligence.

Sky Guardian AI is a reflection of my engineering mindset and my goal
to contribute to advanced automation in US tech environments.
